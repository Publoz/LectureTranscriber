Thanks for getting this university hack.

The first thing you must do is ensure you have downloaded the following softwares.
-Firefox
-Geckodriver
-ffmpeg

Additionally you will need to know the path to certain locations of their installs.
(Every path needs 2 backslashes instead of usual 1 slash)

Geckodriver requires the path to its .exe
e.g C:\\Users\\paulo\\Desktop\\geckodriver.exe
ffmpeg requires the path to its bin
e.g C:\\Users\\paulo\\Desktop\\ffmpeg-n4.4-latest-win64-gpl-4.4\\bin

The location to a firefox profile that is setup correctly is also needed.

To setup:
Use firefox and download a .mp4 file and make sure when the download pop up
comes up you select 'save' and don't ask again. You also need to go to settings
on Firefox and change the download folder to LectureTranscribe.

Once that is done find the location of your firefox profile by going to
about:profiles - in firefox url
e.g C:\\Users\\paulo\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\wv2i9hgv.default-release


Now the values can be added to the values.txt file so that it is remembered and stored.
The first line should have your student username for blackboard
e.g STUDENT\irelanpaul
The next line is for your password
e.g didyouthinkiwouldtypemypassword
Next is your gecko driver .exe location
Next is your firefox profile location
Then your ffmpeg bin folder location
Finally put the path to the Lecture Transcribe folder and end it with \\ 
e.g 'D:\\projects\\LectureTranscribe\\'

Line 7 should say "Courses" - don't touch
From here you can put in each course code and the next line after a code
should be the link to the panopto vstream link

-repeat for all courses - mine looks like

After the last link there should be 'END' to signal the end of the file

Enjoy
